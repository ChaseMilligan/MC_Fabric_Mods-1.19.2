# Instructions & Info
Here is a little step by step on how to get these setup. It is very easy and should only take a few minutes.

1. Download this repo as as a zip file.
2. Open the zip and extract it to wherever you would like. It can be deleted shortly after setup
3. Double-click on the executable file "fabric-installer-0.10.2.exe". Your computer's anti-virus may warn you that this file is dangerous, I promise you it isn't. If you have not installed minecraft on your default drive you might need to alter the destination of the install (this step is smilar to installing optifine if you have done that before).
4. Once the fabric installer has been allowed to run you should see a "mods" directory in your .minecraft folder (Press Windows + R, then type "%appdata%" and hit enter.) Go ahead and replace that with the mods folder from this repo.
5. Now you can laaunch minecraft, and make sure to select the fabric loader profile that should have been created by default.
6. On the title screen you should see that it says in the bottom left corner that your are playing on a modded version of the game. Also go into a single player world to confirm that the mods appear to be working correctly.

If all that goes off without a hitch, congratulations you are ready to enjoy playing on our server at maximum capacity!
